## Biomedical AI Lab | Graduate researcher
Lead a team of 5 graduate researchers working on a battle space simulation using deep reinforcement
learning.

Worked with the company funding the project, CAE, to develop a software that could be used for pilot
training and battle scenarios.

Developed an efficient neural visual coding notebook that demonstrates the encoding strategy of
simple cells in the primary visual cortex.

Implemented independent component analysis, unsupervised machine learning strategies and early
sensory neuroscience to produce neurally-appropriate receptive field models.

## Senning Lab | Research Volunteer | Spring 2021
Compared known DNA sequences with those synthesized in the Senning Lab with the goal of
confirming the presence of specific mutations.

Utilized Snapgene to manipulate and visualize the DNA sequence.

Edited DNA sequencing to developed primers for site directed mutagenesis for 17 different sites on
TRPV1.

## Neuroscience Undergraduate Research Program | Independent Research | Spring 2021
Composed a 15 minute presentation on Recurrent Neural Networks to validate its usefulness in the field of Neuroscience and presented it to over 100 professors, specialist and students.

Compiled review papers and research readings on Neural Networks, Deep learning/Machine Learning to assess the utility of Recurrent Neural Networks.

## Project SEED | Research Assistant | Spring 2020
Worked directly with Dr. Su Yeong Kim to organize meetings for over 50 RAs and families. 

Objective of this project was the determine the effect on children who translate for English limited parents as it
relates to their socioemotional development, academic development, and overall health.

Developed a database for tracking participants (greater than 200 patients with over 10 data points each)
